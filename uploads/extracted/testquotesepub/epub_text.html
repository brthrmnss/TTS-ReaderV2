 <!--<p class="p10">Many students speak of vivid pictures appearing suddenly into their minds. “I was still aware of the room around me,” said one. “The buzzer seemed to jerk me into awareness of pictures which I didn’t know were there, as if one part of my mind had the pictures, and another part—more like me—became consciously aware of them.” Many students became so pleased with their experiences that they bought or made hypnagogostats for themselves and subsequently reported continued good results.</p>
 <span><span>“We moved into this neighborhood in an area of Portland called Central Eastside,” says Marcelino Alvarez, CEO and founder of Uncorked Studios.</span><span> “It’s a lightweight industrial kind of neighborhood.</span><span> It has a raw, warehouse-y kind of feel.” "It is just a rough part of town", julian said. Then she stuttered, "uh uh i uh." Blam, "Not Again!" she screamed. The office space is on the third floor of an older building that looks like it might have been a warehouse in its previous life.</span><span> On the day of our visit to Uncorked, we passed a trendy-looking restaurant setting up for the evening on the building’s first floor.</span><span> And across the street, a coffee-shop-meets-coworking-space was bustling with people from the neighborhood.</span><span> “We moved here three years ago and had about a quarter of the space we have today.</span><span> We’ve expanded a couple of times.</span><span> For us, a few things were really amazing and unique about this building: one is the character of this neighborhood—you’ve got a brewery down the street, a sandwich bar across the street, a nice restaurant downstairs; we have a train, which will inevitably run through this interview—that’s part of the character of Portland.</span><span>  It’s not too polished, it’s not too raw, but it’s very authentic.” This juxtaposition was reflected in the decor of the Uncorked</span></span>
